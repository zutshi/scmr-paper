The implementation was prototyped as S3CAM-R, an extension to our
previously mentioned tool S3CAM \cite{zutshi2014multiple}. OLS regression
routines were used from Scikit-learn~\cite{pedregosa2011scikit}, a
Python module for machine learning. SAL~\cite{SAL-SRI}
with Yices2~\cite{dutertre2014yices} was the model checker and the SMT
solver.

We used S3CAM to discover the abstraction graph $G$, which was then
trimmed of the nodes which did not contribute to the error search
(nodes from which error nodes were not reachable). In our experiments we
used $1$-relational modeling to create the transition system from $G$.
Using SAL, we checked for the given safety property. If a concrete
trace was obtained from the BMC, it was further checked for validity
by simulating using $\simulate$ to see if it was indeed an error
trace.  If not, $100$ samples from its associated abstract state was
sampled to check the presence of a counter-example in it
neighborhood. This can be further extended by obtaining different
discrete sequences or discrete trace sequences from the model checker.

We tabulate our preliminary evaluation in \tabref{res-rel}. We used
few of the benchmarks described in \cite{zutshi2014multiple}, including the Van
der Pol oscillator, Brusselator, Lorenz attractor and the Navigation
benchmark. As before, we ran S3CAM-R $10$ times with different seeds
and averaged the results. We tabulate both the total time taken and
the time taken by SAL to compute the counter-example and compare
against a newer implementation of S3CAM. Note that different
abstraction parameters are used for S3CAM and S3CAM-R, due to the
differences in which they operate.

The results show promise, but clearly S3CAM performs better. Also,
S3CAM-R timed out on some benchmarks like Nav $\prop_R$, Nav $\prop_S$
and the bouncing ball. However, we need to explore more benchmarks to
be conclusive. S3CAM-R's performance can be explained by the
difficulty in finding a good abstraction ($\quant_\epsilon$), which
needs to be fine enough, to obtain good prediction models but coarse
enough, to be manageable by the current SMT solvers. Specifically, to
obtain a good quality counter-example from the model checker (and
avoid false positives), the transition system should be created from
models with high accuracy, for which a finer abstraction is required.
However, the exploration of a finer abstraction is exponentially more
complex and results in a much bigger transition system, which the
current state of the art bounded model checkers (which use SMT
solvers) can not handle under reasonable resources.
