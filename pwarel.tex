\subsection{Overview}
\label{sec:ovw}

We now briefly describe the approach. Given a numerical simulator
$\simulate$ and an initial abstraction defined by a quantization
function $\quant_\epsilon$ and a time step $\Delta$, we use
scatter-and-simulate (parameterized by number of samples $n$ as
described in \cite{zutshi2014multiple}) to explore the abstract graph
$\scr{H}(\Delta)$. The result is a graph $G$, which has a finite
number of abstract states $C$ (or cells) and edges $(C,C')$ iff $C
\areach{\Delta} C'$.

Instead of using a CEGAR like loop (as in \cite{zutshi2014multiple}), we use the
generated trajectory segments to learn quantitative models describing
the local behavior of the system. These models are defined by a set of
relations $R \subseteq \HybridStates \times \HybridStates$ for each
edge of the reachability graph.

\input{figs/segtraj_rel_enriched.tex}

Recall that each edge $(C,C')$ of the graph $G$ denotes an observed
trajectory segment between the respective cells. The graph abstraction
$G$ only states that there exists a state $\x \in C$ from which the
system can evolve to a future state $\x' \in C'$. To increase the
precision we iteratively refined the abstraction by state
splitting. Instead, we now propose an `enrichment' $G^R$ of $G$ by computing a
set of local relations $R_{(C,C')}(\x,\x')$ for every edge $(C,C')$,
which non-deterministically describe relations between $\x \in C$ and $\x'
\in C'$. This is illustrated in \figref{enriched-edge}.
%(compare with \figref{segtraj}).

The enriched graph $G^R$ captures the underlying local forward
dynamics describing the evolution of the system in each abstract
state. We represent the dynamics using an affine model with an
interval error. Such a model can either be approximated using learning
methods or computed as a sound (over) approximation using reachability
set computation methods. Because we assume black box semantics, we
only present the former. Using regression analysis on the $start$ and
$end$ states of the witnessed trajectory segments between two cells,
we compute an approximate discrete map along with an error estimate.
Moreover, using the simulation function $\simulate$, additional
trajectory segments (or data) can be generated if required. The data
can be separated into a training set and testing set to compute the
map and the error respectively.  The latter case can be explored if
the symbolic dynamics of the system are known. A tool like
\flowstar~\cite{chen2013flow} can be used to find the reachable set
map.

Observe that $G^R$, a directed reachability graph, is rich enough to
search for concrete behaviors in the system. We call it a time
parameterized PWA relational abstraction. It can be interpreted as an
infinite state discrete transition system, and we can use
off-the-shelf bounded model checkers to find concrete violations of a
given safety property, and even other temporal properties.  We now
discuss the background required to present our ideas.


\section{Relational Modeling}

We now describe how relational models can be computed for a given
black box system by enriching the abstract reachability graph obtained
by scatter-and-simulate. We first formalize the notion of an enriched
graph, and then show how they can be interpreted as a PWA transition
system using $k$-relational modeling.

\subsection{Abstract Enriched Graph}

The existential abstraction relation in \cite{zutshi2014multiple} was defined as
follows:
\[
%\exists \x\in\C. \exists \x'\in\C'. \x'=\simulate(\x, \tau) \iff \C\rel{\tau}\C'
    C \areach{t} C' \iff \exists \x \in C.\ \exists \x' \in C'.\ \x \areach{t} \x'
\]
The abstract relation $\areach{t}$ can be enriched by incorporating
the affine relation between $\x$ and $\x'$. For an arbitrary dynamical
system, such a relation can be rarely represented using an exact affine map.
This is due to the presence of non-linear and hybrid behaviors. But,
an affine map can always be estimated with an error.

If the system dynamics are completely specified in the form of a white
box model, we can use first order approximations to find the affine
expressions for the relations. Using a tool like \flowstar, we can
obtain sound over-approximate affine maps of the form $A\x + [\vb^l,
\vb^h]$, where $[\vb^l,\vb^h]$ denotes the interval of vectors, such
that, every element $b_i$ of the vector $\vb$ is contained in the
respective scalar interval $b_i\in[b^l_i,b^h_i]$.

For the case of black box systems, such a sound approximation is not
possible. Instead, we rely on a statistical method like simple linear
regression to estimate the affine map $\amap: A\x + \vb$. We then
estimate the error $\delta$ and generalize $\amap$ to an interval
affine map as before $\amap: A\x + \vb + \delta$.  Finally, we get an
abstraction with the below relation
\[
    C \areach{f} C' \iff \exists \x \in C.\ \exists \x' \in C'.\ \x' \in A\x + \vb \pm \delta.
    %C \areach{A\x+\vb+\delta} C' \iff \exists \x \in C.\ \exists \x' \in C'.\
\]

However, in the presence of complex non-linear behavior, using a
single affine map can lead to a poor approximation. To increase the
precision, one can use more than one affine map. Let us denote this set as
$R_{(C,C')}$ (ref.~\secref{ovw}).
\[
    R_{(C,C')}(\x,\x'): \setof{f_i \;|\; \exists \x \in C.\ \exists \x' \in C'.\ \x' \in f_i(\x)}
\]

\end{figure}

As shown in \figref{enrichment}, we use OLS to compute an enrichment
of the abstraction graph $G$. For every edge $(C,C') \in edges(G)$,
the set of relations $R_{(C,C')}(\x,\x')$ is computed. The semantics
of the enriched edge are clearly non-deterministic. Form a state $\x
\in C$, any $f_i\in R_{(C,C')}$ can be taken as long as $\x' \in C$'
is satisfied. This interpretation results in an infinite state
transition system. We now detail the construction of the set
$R_{(C,C')}$ using $k$-relational modeling.

% We now compute a PWA model for a given black box system by estimating
% the dynamics using OLS. We can estimate the affine relations between
% every cell, but as discussed in ~\chapref{abs}, it is a futile
% approach.  Instead, we use the same heuristic as before:
% scatter-and-simulate, to select the cell relations for estimation. We
% build the reachability graph as before, but in addition, annotate each
% edge with the values of estimated $A$, $\vb$, and $\delta$ for the
% respective relation. The reachability graph thus computed, is a
% transition system. Using off-the-shelf bounded model checkers, we
% reason about the system's safety properties.

\end{figure}

Given a $G$, when computing the set of relations for an edge $R$, we
consider only the set of abstract states reachable at a specific time
step.  Intuitively, one might consider the states reachable in one
time step $\Delta$.  However, such a process can be generalized by
looking at the states reachable at ${0\Delta, 1\Delta, \ldots,
k\Delta}$ time steps.

Using \figref{k-rel}, we illustrate this notion. To compute
$R_{(C,C')}$, we
split the data set $D(C,C')$ consisting of trajectory segments (of time lengths
$k\Delta$) as follows.  We observe the local behavior of the system by
noting the evolution of the system $\System$ from a state $\x(t)
\in C$ for a time length dependant on $k$. For
\begin{itemize}
    \item{$k=0$}: we observe all trajectory segments of length $\Delta$.
    \item{$k=1$}: we observe trajectory segments of length $\Delta$, which satisfy $\x(t+\Delta) \in C'$.
    \item{$k=2$}: we observe trajectory segments of length $2\Delta$,
        and split them in two sets (a) and (b) on the basis of the
        cells reached at time $(t+\Delta)$ and $(t+2\Delta)$.
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
            \item $\x(t+\Delta) \in C' \land \x(t+2\Delta) \in C''_1$
            \item $\x(t+\Delta) \in C' \land \x(t+2\Delta) \in C''_2$
        \end{enumerate}
    \item{$k=n$}: we observe trajectory segments of length $n\Delta$,
        and split them in to multiple sets on the basis of the cells
        reached at time $(t+\Delta),\; (t+2\Delta),\;
        \ldots,\;(t+n\Delta)$.
\end{itemize}

$k$-relational modeling can be understood as a heuristic, which uses
the underlying abstraction to differentiate behaviors of the system
which `diverge' (or are revealed to be `distinct' at a future time).
Such a heuristic can be useful in increasing the precision of the
learnt affine maps.  We now formalize this notion for $k=0$, $1$, and
$n$ and illustrate using examples.

\end{figure}

When $k=0$, the $0$-relational model is a PWA transition system which only
defines the evolution of states $\x$, and does not specify the
reachable cell. The guard predicates of the relations are defined over
cells: $g_i(\x): \x \in C_i$ while $g'_i(\x'): True$.

We use regression to estimate the dynamics for the outgoing trajectory
segments form a cell $C$. Hence, the data set $\ds$ for the regression
includes all trajectory segments beginning from the same cell
\[
    \ds = \setof{\pi_t | start(\pi_t) \in C}.
\]
This includes trajectory segments ending in different cells, as shown
in ~\figref{k0}. For $N$ cells, this results in a $\rho$ with $N$ transition relations.
\begin{equation*}
    \scr{T} = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            g_1(\x):\vx \in C_1 \implies A_1\vx + \vb_1 + \delta_1\\
            \ldots \\
            g_n(\x):\vx \in C_n \implies A_n\vx + \vb_n + \delta_n\\
        \end{array}
    \right.
\end{equation*}

Note that this can be quite imprecise when the cells are big,
containing regions of state-space with complex dynamics. This is true
for both non-linear systems and hybrid dynamical system, where a cell
can contain two or more modes with differing continuous dynamics.

To improve the preciseness of learnt dynamics, we include the
reachability relation in the
regression. For every relation $C\areach{t}C'$, the data set $\ds$ is
comprised only of trajectory segments $\pi_t$ which start and end in
the same set of cells.
\[
    \ds = \setof{\pi_t | start(\pi_t) \in C \land end(\pi_t) \in C'}.
\]
For $N$ edges in $G$, $1$-relationalization results in a $\rho$ with
$N$ transition relations.

\figref{k1} illustrates the $k=1$ refinement of the case shown in
\figref{k0}. The data set $\ds$ is split into two data sets $\ds_1
= \setof{\pi_1, \pi_2}$ and $\ds_2 = \setof{\pi_3}$, using which, two
relations are constructed. The resulting $1$-relational model
is at least as precise as the corresponding $0$-relational model.

Finally, we generalize the relational models to $k$-relational PWA
models. A $k$-relational model is constructed by using $k$ length
\textit{connected} segmented trajectories. A segmented trajectory $\SegTraj$ is
\textit{connected} iff its cost $\cost(\SegTraj) = 0$.

Two $\SegTraj:\tupleof{\pi_{t_1}, \ldots, \pi_{t_k}}$ and
$\SegTraj':\tupleof{\pi'_{t_1}, \ldots, \pi'_{t_k}}$ are
\textit{similar} if their trajectory segments have the same sequence
of cell traversals $\tupleof{C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_k}$, \ie
\begin{align*}
    \forall i\in\setof{1 \ldots k}.
    & start(\pi_{t_i}) \in C_i          
    \land start(\pi'_{t_i}) \in C_i \land  \\
    & end(\pi_{t_i}) \in C_{i+1}  
    \land end(\pi'_{t_i}) \in C_{i+1}
\end{align*}

For every cell $C$ in the reachability graph, we construct a data set
$\ds$ by collecting $\pi_{t_i}$, such that they are the first segment of $k$
length \textit{connected} and \textit{similar} segmented trajectories.
%\[
%    \ds = \setof{\pi_{\tau_i} |
%        \pi_{\tau_i}
%        start(\pi_{\tau_{i}}) \in C_i
%        \land
%        end(\pi_{\tau_{i}}) \in C_i}
