The PWA transition system is a finite location, infinite state
transition system. As all the guards and transitions are affine, a
bounded reachability query is equivalent to checking all
combinations of discrete locations, where each combination can be
summarized as a linear program. As the time is bounded, the number of
combinations are finite, but, exponential in number.

It should be noted that an explicit execution of the transition system
represents a directed acyclic graph, with each location being a node,
and a directed edge from each node to all nodes reachable in forward
time. A path on this graph is then a linear program, with each
branching node corresponding to a logical disjunction.

Temporal properties of PWA transitions systems can be checked using
off-the-shelf model checkers like SAL~\cite{SAL-SRI}, which can reason
over infinite state transitions systems using SMT solvers.
Furthermore, lazy SMT solvers can be employed for this specific
problem instance to achieve better efficiency~\cite{shoukry2017smc}.
We now show how relational PWA abstractions can be viewed as PWA
transition systems, and how the problem of falsification can
be answered by a BMC query.
