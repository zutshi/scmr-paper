\mypara{Falsification of Properties of Hybrid Systems.} The current
state-of-the-art falsification approaches are based on numerical
simulations and can be grouped into guided
S-Taliro~\cite{annpureddy2011s}, Breach~\cite{donze2010breach}
and randomly search RRT
An alternative was proposed by the authors in the form of a CEGAR
like search.
The other common approaches involve modeling the given system using
hybrid automata and exhaustively checking them.


\mypara{Identification of hybrid systems} using Piece-Wise affine
models is surveyed in~\cite{paoletti2007identification}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Expressiveness/power of PWA models?
\item Fixed time caveats
\item Effects of refining parameters: time step $\Delta$ and grid size $\epsilon$.
\end{enumerate}
